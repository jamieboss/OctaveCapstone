# This is the README for Team Octave's Capstone Project.

## Requirements 
At the end of the project, we'll need to list our requirements needed for the application
i.e
`pip install spotipy`
`pip install elasticsearch`

## Opening the Flask Back-End Port
`cd flask`
`py -m flask run`

## Starting up ElasticSearch
In a new command terminal...
1. Download Elasticsearch if you have not already: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/zip-windows.html
2. In a terminal window, `cd` to elasticsearch directory you just downloaded
3. Run `.\bin\elasticsearch`


## Running the Web Application
In another new command terminal...
`cd octave-app`  
`npm start`
The Octave Application will now be online at 'localhost:3000'
